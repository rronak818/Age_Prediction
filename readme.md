# Age Prediction System

## Overview

The Age Prediction System is a real-time application that estimates a person's age based on facial images captured through a camera. Utilizing deep learning and image processing techniques, this system provides accurate age predictions, making it useful for a variety of applications, such as security, marketing, and user engagement.

## Features

- **Real-Time Image Capture**: Capture live images using a webcam or camera feed.
- **Accurate Age Predictions**: Leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on diverse datasets.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI for easy interaction and viewing of predictions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `OpenCV` for image processing
  - `TensorFlow`/`Keras` for machine learning

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/age-prediction-system.git
   cd age-prediction-system
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Running the Application

1. **Launch the Application**:
   ```bash
   python age_gen.py

## Usage

- Start the application, and it will begin capturing images automatically.
- The predicted age will be displayed alongside the captured image.
